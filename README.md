# Color Me Calm

## What is Color Me Calm?
Color me Calm is a Javascript Canvas based web application that allows the user to upload a image and color a pixelated version of it by coloring squares that match the selected palette number. Features include: ability to click and hold to color, seeing finished image side by side with original image at the end, and ability to upload own picture.

## Inspiration?
Initially created for the Waterloo Game Jam September 2018. Game Jam is a hackathon like event where groups come together to make a game in 48-hours and while we did this, we also continued to improve the product after the Game Jam.
